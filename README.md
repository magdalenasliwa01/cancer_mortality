# The main objective of the data analysis within the use of Machine Learning model is the prediction of 
the mortality for people suffering from cancer in the United States, in each region separately. If the 
number of cancer cases would increase in 10 years, it can be predicted how many people will pass 
away within the Linear Regression model and the appropriately chosen algorithm.
