# Prediction of the cancer mortality rate for residents of the United States with the use of the Machine Learning Linear Regression model


The project's main objective is the prediction of the mortality rate for people suffering from cancer in the United States, in each State separately. The analysis aims to discover the correlation between cancer cases and mortality across 10 years.


The Supervised Machine Learning model of Linear Regression was used with the aim of learning model to show the number of deaths assigned accordingly to the number of cases. The main goal is to predict the number of deaths based on the data gathered from the www.data.world repository analysing all cancer trials from 1st January 2010 to 6th January 2016. Data representing all the clinical trials, census income, population by region, cancer death rates by region etc. 

R2 = 0.972

The R-squared of 0.972 calculated for the Linear Regression Model has a strong relationship and very good 
fit of the regression line, meaning the regression was able to capture almost 100% of the variance in 
the target variable.
