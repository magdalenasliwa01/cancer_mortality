# Prediction of the mortality rate for residents of the United States who suffer from cancer within use of the Linear Regression model.


The main objective of the project is prediction of the mortality rate for people suffering from cancer in the United States, in each State separately. The analysis aim into discovering the correlation between the cancer cases and mortality across 10 years.


The Supervised Machine Learning model of Linear Regression was used in aim of learning model to show the number of deaths assigned accordingly to the number of cases. The main goal is to be able to predict the number of deaths based on the data gathered from the www.data.world repository analysing all cancer trails from 1st January 2010 to 6th january 2016. Data representing all the clinical trials, census income, population by region, cancer death rates by region etc. 

R2 = 0.972

R-squared of 0.972 calculated for the Linear Regression Model has strong relationship and very good 
fit of the regression line, meaning the regression was able to capture almost 100% of the variance in 
the target variable.
